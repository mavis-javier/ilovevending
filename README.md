This repository is intended to store the ilovevending website for the Vending and Distribution Company my family owns.

# Current Project
I am currently working on building the website from the grassroot level. I share my code to show others how I learn and start developing a website for a company. I hope others find this helpful and be inspired to learn scripting and programming and incorporate them into something useful.
