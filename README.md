# DEAJ-LLC
This repository is intended to store projects I have for DEAJ, the Vending and Distribution Company my family owns and give me the opportunity of apprenticeship.

# Current Project
I am currently working on building the website from the grassroot level. I share my code to show others how I learn and start developing a website for a company.
I hope others find this helpful and be inspired to learn scripting and programming and incorporate them into something useful.

# Other Projects
There will be more projects added to this repository for DEAJ LLC. I will continue to work on projects my dad and I have for the business since it deals with technological advances on retail services such as vending machines
Should there be any other projects not related to DEAJ, check out my other repositories or my account to see if it may be your interest!
